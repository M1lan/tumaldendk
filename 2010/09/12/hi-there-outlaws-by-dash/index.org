Hi_there_outlaws_!_*by_dash

general
My name is Arpad !
Â 
I also go by the pseudonym "dash".

Iâ€™m an active professional teamplayer of the first person shooter series
Quake.
Â 
Iâ€™m of Hungarian nationality, resides in Budapest and at the moment I play
for the National electronic sports team of Hungary, and for an international
TDM team, called Frontline.
Â 
Iâ€™ve been playing the third episode of Quake, since 1999 (Q3 beta), and
actively competing in Quake since 2002.
Â 
I gained prominence with the gametype 2on2 TDM, which is still the most loving
mode of mine, but lately I only play 4v4 TeamDeathMatch competitively.
Â 
Iâ€™m here to help my friend dk, to share the basics of TDM, and some of the
finest tactics with beginners, and experts also.
Â 
So letâ€™s get ready to rumble, and have a good read!
