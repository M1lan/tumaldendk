Yo_mofos_!_*by_JoCKo

Y0 mofos!
Â 
Â 
My name is Jan alias Jocko.

Nick made it up Dzodzo in one computer camp back in 1995 â€“ he did some
declension of Joseph Stalin and somehow it came to Jocko.

I decided to help to one of my unnamed clan colleagues from 4Kings.

My story is a bit longer; the one knows me can skip the following lines.

My first experience with cleaning the bots out of a map was in Quake 1 in 1997
at and with my cousin Dzodzo.
As far as for the internet conditions at that time in Slovakia concerns â€“
they were like in outer Mongolia.

My serious gaming began in 1998 in a gaming club â€“ where I experienced the
smell of multiplayer`s blood for the first time along with my second cousin
Wepman at Quake 2.
Â 
We established together with Wepman and Dzodzo the clan â€œSatan`s Proxiesâ€
on 13th of January 1999 which practically exists up to the presentâ€¦this is
how it all began, at least for me.

I existed on Slovak 64Kb ISDN inÂ  the years 1999-2002 and was engrossed in the
team game of Quake 3; although to run with ping 100+ was an experience for my
nerves.
I left for progaming retirement between 2003 and 2004 and then was fully
devoted to my comeback in 2005 â€“ when they introduced a cable connection in
Slovakia; to be more specific â€“ it helped me to return to the form
#tdmpickup.se.

Since then I have been virtually playing up to now. Among my greatest successes
â€“ I consider my attendance on WCG 2k2 inÂ  South Korea and several victories
at local TDM LAN.

I`d like to gain an advantage from the years spent at Quake and give you advice
at some maps â€“ how to proceed even againstÂ  stronger andÂ  more experienced
teams.
Â 
Hail the hunt!
