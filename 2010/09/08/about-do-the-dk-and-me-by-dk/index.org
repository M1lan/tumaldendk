About_do_the_dk_and_me_*by_dk

Hey Guys,
Â 
my Name is Cris aka â€ždkâ€œ !
I am playing for the UK Organisation / Team 4Kings.
Chek it out -> www.four-kings.com
Â 
I decided to start this site because I cant really read that much about the tdm
scene, like news, basics, tactics, where to play, how to play especially for
those who are new to the game.
Â 
I am still not sure if I will go through with it, but I give it a try !
It depends on the response and on the time it will cost. Lets seeâ€¦ Â 
Â 
For those who donâ€™t know me here the little dk story.
Â 
I started in 1997 with Quake 1, the same year I started aswell with
onlinegaming and the game Quakeworld wich is basically quake 1 just for the
internet.
My nickname was DaKilla.
The nick is really innovative, I know !
But I felt like a DaKilla because I owned my neighbor always in lan.
I think it was November 1997 where I became my first modem.
It was a 28.8 Modem. I just can tell you, AMAZING !!!!
I had like ping 300 and I was totally flashed. People flying around ( hahah
yes, I thought they was able to fly, but they just did a rocketjump ) 20 People
on the same time on ONE server, without going to the neighboor, just being at
home on your own Computer.
It was amazing and I was immediently addicted.
For not annoying you and making the story that long I will push sometimes the
forward button.
I really cnat remember but I think it was in 98 somewhen I became my 56K Modem,
WHAT a difference, I had ping 150 !!!Â 
The things became more interesting, I found my first Team, Syndicate â€“ X and
played in my first league. I still can remember to that team we prac with a
lot. TFP the fraggin pumpkins. With outcast, spawney, root66 etc. If you guys
read that â€œ HELLO ! â€œ :-)
In 99 I finally became ISDN and a really nice ping around 30 or something. And
I became better and better finally.
Not Top but better ;-) .
In QW there are really some crazy skilled people.
In 2001 I finally started with Quake 3.
I started playing Quake3 in SD but moved a few weeks later to 4Kings.
And that was the beginning of a pretty successful Gaming carrier and my
nickname change to dk wich is deka and has nothing to do anymore with dakilla :
-).
