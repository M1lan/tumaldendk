Deep Inside - OSPDM5

Deep Inside - OSPDM5 Strategy Guide *by JCK

Â 
Very legible map, similarly as by the others, timing and coordinationÂ  are in
focus in the first place.
There is only one power-up in it so every unused may lead a team which ignores
it to its doom.
It can be played in different ways, I `ll try to show some tips and tricks :-
)Â 

Items Available
Â 
Weapons


* 2 Shotgun (SG)
* 1 Railgun ( RG )
* 1 Grenade Launcher (GL)
* 1 Lightning Gun (LG)
* 2 Rocket Launcher (RL)
* 1 Plasma Gun (PG)


Armors


* 1 Red Armor (RA)
* 2 Yellow Armor (YA)
* 7 Shards
* 1 Mega Health (MH)
* 1 50Health
* 13 25 Health


Powerups
Â 

* Quad

Â 
Quad - Railgun
Â 
RG

It is good to check your rail-gun and mega-health (The person who checks it
should only collect shards and mega-health), the enemies are vulnerable easily
and they cannot endanger you at aÂ distance. IÂ advise you to go for the mega-
health few seconds in advance and look around if there is no enemy hidden
there. In front of Quad-damage it is recommended when two players secure the
rail-gun as it is shown on the picture below. We pay attention to
sound especially â€“ which comes from jump-padÂ  - and we secure
the entrance into which the enemies from RA may jump to.

Quad
Â 
It is ideal when the group of players in front of Quad would be in positions as
it is shown on the picture below, but it isn`t always possibleJ.
Positions

No 1 is a RG boy â€“ he looks after the RG for his colleagues so they can have
it and shoot at distance â€“ to secure the rail-gun and mega-health. Position
Â 
No 2 is quite difficult, the difficulty depends upon how you play it. His task
is to always have in grasp when there will be RA and MH; eventually YA,Â  in
front of Quad he secures No1. The given person secures the jump-pad and
entrance from YA at position
Â 
No 3; apart from it, he checks the situation in central room and makes his
timings for 2 YA or mega. Position
Â 
No 4 gives a hand to number two and three â€“ it depends on where is the bulk
of enemies.

Â 
WTF? QUAD LOST ! CENTRAL & RA ROOM

It is usual in ospdm5 that the position at rail-gun is often exchanged â€“
therefore it is important to keep your head cool and start from nothing â€“
what is RA in this case. Pay attention mainly to LG and RA; eventually, you try
to get some time MH. You can attack the quad directly with RAÂ  - but carefully
â€“ as normally you have nothing available to shower the enemy at distance!

Â 

The picture above depicts the attack on quad when you don`t have the upper hand
at Quad -Rail-gun. Position No 1 takes care of that the enemy doesn`tÂ  eat RA
or he eventually makes timing for LG (it is good to know the timing of mega as
well). He attacks straight through RA or carefully through jump-pad.Â  Position
No 2 secures the central room and the situation at quad. No 4 prevailingly
attacks through YA or directly from central room. Position No 3 is quite
complicated â€“ as you look after what is going on in the lower part of the
map. Usually he tries to get mega under control; it is good when No 1 gives a
hand at it. He tries to get on quad through the jump-pad or RG. The last
position No 4 must have in grasp over
those two YA, he attacks mainly through the upper YA
(it is usually effective in combination with a rocket-jumpJ) along with No 2.

  peanie: situations can be random, depends if u play patient/slow game or
  stable rush @ quad (if u know that enmy is low @ rail f.e etc.). RA room is
  good starting position to regain control when is every corner lost :P.
