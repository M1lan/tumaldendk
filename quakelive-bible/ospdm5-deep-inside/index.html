<p>
Very legible map, similarly as by the others, timing and coordination  are in
focus in the first place.
</p>
<p>
There is only one power-up in it so every unused may lead a team which ignores
it to its doom.
</p>
<p>
It can be played in different ways, I'll try to show some tips and tricks :-)

</ul>

<p>Quad - Railgun
</p>
<p>
RG
</p>
<p>
It is good to check your rail-gun and mega-health (The person who checks it
should only collect shards and mega-health), the enemies are vulnerable easily
and they cannot endanger you at a distance. I advise you to go for the mega-
health few seconds in advance and look around if there is no enemy hidden
there. In front of Quad-damage it is recommended when two players secure the
rail-gun as it is shown on the picture below. We pay attention to
sound especially which comes from jump-pad  - and we secure
the entrance into which the enemies from RA may jump to.
</p>
<p>
Quad
</p>
<p>
It is ideal when the group of players in front of Quad would be in positions as
it is shown on the picture below, but it isn`t always possibleJ.
Positions
</p>
<p>
No 1 is a RG boy he looks after the RG for his colleagues so they can have
it and shoot at distance to secure the rail-gun and mega-health. Position
</p>
<p>
No 2 is quite difficult, the difficulty depends upon how you play it. His task
is to always have in grasp when there will be RA and MH; eventually YA,  in
front of Quad he secures No1. The given person secures the jump-pad and
entrance from YA at position
</p>
<p>
No 3; apart from it, he checks the situation in central room and makes his
timings for 2 YA or mega. Position
</p>
<p>
No 4 gives a hand to number two and three it depends on where is the bulk
of enemies.
</p>

<p>
WTF? QUAD LOST ! CENTRAL &amp; RA ROOM
</p>
<p>
It is usual in ospdm5 that the position at rail-gun is often exchanged
therefore it is important to keep your head cool and start from
nothing what is RA in this case. Pay attention mainly to LG and RA; eventually, you try
to get some time MH. You can attack the quad directly with RA  - but
carefully as normally you have nothing available to shower the enemy at distance!
</p>


<p>
The picture above depicts the attack on quad when you don`t have the upper hand
at Quad -Rail-gun. Position No 1 takes care of that the enemy doesn`t  eat RA
or he eventually makes timing for LG (it is good to know the timing of mega as
well). He attacks straight through RA or carefully through jump-pad.  Position
No 2 secures the central room and the situation at quad. No 4 prevailingly
attacks through YA or directly from central room. Position No 3 is quite
complicated as you look after what is going on in the lower part of the
map. Usually he tries to get mega under control; it is good when No 1 gives a
hand at it. He tries to get on quad through the jump-pad or RG. The last
position No 4 must have in grasp over
those two YA, he attacks mainly through the upper YA
(it is usually effective in combination with a rocket-jumpJ) along with No 2.
