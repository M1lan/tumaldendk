Grim Dungeons - DM14

DM14 Strategy Guide *by dkÂ 

A map with many corners.This map is played in a campy way since DM14 is
subdivided in 2 parts, and on both sites you have more or less equal health,
armor und weapons and powerups.
It sounds probably pretty easy to play but DM14 depends all about you, your
Team and the opponents playingwhise and how the powerups are going to spawn.
DM14 is probably the map wich needs the most tactics and careful thinking. 10
Frags can be a lot on this map.

Items Available
Â 
Weapons

* 1 Shotgun (SG)
* 1 Railgun ( RG )
* 1 Grenade Launcher (GL)
* 1 Lightning Gun (LG)
* 2 Rocket Launcher (RL)

Armors

* 1 Red Armor (RA)
* 2 Yellow Armor (YA)
* 5 Shards

Powerups
Â 

* Battlesuit
* Quad

Â 
Â 
First in the RA Room
Â 
It is always good starting in the Red Armor room.
Â 
Tell it your mates that you have Red. They need to come quick and help you !Â 

Â Red is the position you want !
Why ?

  1. You can safe it easier
  2. You have 100point Armor + 25 extra ( shards @ Shotgunroom )
  3. You are next to Battlestuit
  4. You can get easier and safe the Rail
  5. You have totally 3 Weapons there ( RL, Rail, Shotgun )
  6. You can make pressure through 3 Ways

Â 
Red is subdivided into 4 positions.Â  Make them safe and hold them !
Â 

Â 
1.
A lot of times an enemy spawns, no one is there, enemy gets RL, then the Red
Armor, and your advantage is getting smaller, of course it is a extreme lucky
situation but it happens, believe me !
Â 
Â 

2.
This position can be quick an grap the Red Armor ,help Shotgun or Railgun or
killing people who comes through the Jumppad.
Â 
Â 


3.
A really important position for the Red Area,
especially before theÂ  Battlesuit comes.
Make sure you have a RL ! Enemy could try
to get to Battlesuit through this position. But besides that, u have 25 extra
Armor points+ 1 more Weapons ! Keep it safe !!!If your Team is stacked and your
on shotgun, make some pressure at quad, try to nerf the opponents, grab them
the yellow armor or shaft, even its only 1 time BUT as always not by hook or by
crook. Sometimes every frag / kill can be important but donâ€™t chase the
enemy, keep your position.
4.
The 4th position is Rail, make it Safe and dont let the enemy get a Railgun !
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 

Second in the RA Room ? and Lost ?
Â 
Well, go in defense positions and wait forÂ  the next powerup if Red is totally
Lost !
It is not that bad tho losing Red, its only bad wasting frags. Keep them and
get back to Red with the next Powerup.

1.
Standard Positions always 2 at Quad. 1 has to check always shaft/ya area incase
enemy comes from there. The otherone has to check the shotgun door.
Note: QUAD has always priority with saving !!!
2.
Â Two guys are going down to the 2nd RL.
Note: If enemy has a Railgun think about it that you can get railed easy if you
jump up and enemy is railing from shotgun.
3.
Try to get the Railgun or at least doing
pressure there.
Railgun and shaft are 2 really powerfull
weapons to defend the Quadroom.
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Battlesuit time !
Â 
You have Red safe ? Get BS !
The one who has the most armor is going to get Battlesuit !!!
So decide it already as soon as possible.
Â 
This is the best way to safe BS
1.
Safe the Railgun ! Why ?Â Â 
If Enemy is there and they have a Rail they can do easily pressure to BS and in
the worst case they shoot the BSrunner down in the void.
2.
Enemy can go through the Shotgun and trying to get BS through the whole ! Its
not easy to defend it from the whole but it is much easier to grab the BS. And
another point is aswellâ€¦ the guy who takes BS needs protection for not
loosing any armor und health.
3.
This position is aswell important, safe it before BS comes ! Enemy can come
from lower RL and try to get BS. Make sure you have a RL. Incase Rail is lost
you can spam Rockets to Rail. Make sure you have a RL. Incase Rail is lost you
can spam Rockets to Rail.
This position is aswell important, safe it before BS comes !
4.
Â Â Â  But safe it like that ! This is the fastest
Â Â Â  and easiest way to get there !
Â Â Â  A lot of people make the mistake going
Â Â Â  through that whole and jumping over
Â Â Â  the void ! Why ?! The way is longer
Â Â Â  and u have the risk that enemy shoot
Â Â Â  you in the void.
5.
Â Â Â  This is the way the Poweruprunner is going
Â Â Â  to BS ! NEVER goes down 10 sec earlier..
Â Â Â  only in time with bs so get bs timing.
Â Â Â  Note: Incase one enemy get killed and
Â Â Â  spawns red, YOU DONâ€™T CARE !
Â Â Â  Try to protect yourself if possible to get BS
Â Â Â  with most armor and health.
Â 
Â 
Â 

Quad time !
1.
This is the way you are going to safe Quad.
3 People needs to be at Quad.
1 has to check always the shaft / YA area.
Watch out for Railers who doing pressure from the shotgun.
Get the Grenadelauncher and try to pull them back

Â 
2.
This is the Spy ! Check out if enemy coming to Quad through Rail or BS, you
donâ€™t need to fight if its senseless, go better then and join your team at
quad.

  You might want to add that, on dm14, the BS is the stronger of the two
  powerups and why: many corners, easy to engage the quad runner in melee
  distance.

  Nice post! I think many people will highly appreciate this.

  Keeping in mind nyshak's comment I would like to request one more thing
  though, and that was a) can make a real difference on that map and b) you are
  famous for, dk -- sync secondary items with a delayed quad, challenge BS with
  three people etc and what to do when you have Quad while the enemy BS blocks
  the shotgun. That's where imo most players do mistakes.
  Keep up the good work! ;)
