A_chat_with_PerpetualWar_!

I had a nice chat with PerpetualWar about dothedk.com .
Â 
First of all thanks PerpetualWar for your feedback !
Â 
He gave me some nice input, ideas and asked me some questions wich im going to
answer from time to time !
Â 
The plan at the moment is adding every week a new tactic guide.
There are 11 maps at the moment for TDM ( with 2v2 maps ) .Â 
Â 
From time to time i will go deeper and deeper in those guides.
Recognize that i cant and wont go in EVERY situation.
Its to much !
Â 
TDM is something about feeling, experience and of course knowledge what you get
from time to time.
Â 
I try to go as much as possible in standard situations.
Things like, when start to rush, when to stop, what about the important
positions, what happens if we are 20 Frags behind, how important are
communications for the game, what kind of informations are important, what is
the key of a good working team.
Â 
I am not sure how and when ... but this is more or less the "plan" :-)
Â 
Â 
If someone has ideas, suggestions, questions etc. feel free to email
Â 
mail [ a t ] dothedk dot com
Â 
dash, JoCKo or me ( or probably someone else who is going to help here ) are
trying to add or answer it !

Chance_gives_you_a_chance_!_*by_dk

I talked to Chance a few days ago.
Well better said our Bouncers talked to each other, somehow we always missed
each other.
Â 
He started already some nice articles about Quake.Â 
Â 
So... for all who dont know his articles, read them. Thats really nice basic
stuff.
Even that they are made for duel.
But you can assign it to tdm, and probably me, jocko or dash or someone else :-
) will from time to time edit / adapt them.
Â 
You can find the articles in the Quakelive_Bible

Yo_mofos_!_*by_JoCKo

Y0 mofos!
Â 
Â 
My name is Jan alias Jocko.

Nick made it up Dzodzo in one computer camp back in 1995 â€“ he did some
declension of Joseph Stalin and somehow it came to Jocko.

I decided to help to one of my unnamed clan colleagues from 4Kings.

My story is a bit longer; the one knows me can skip the following lines.

My first experience with cleaning the bots out of a map was in Quake 1 in 1997
at and with my cousin Dzodzo.
As far as for the internet conditions at that time in Slovakia concerns â€“
they were like in outer Mongolia.

My serious gaming began in 1998 in a gaming club â€“ where I experienced the
smell of multiplayer`s blood for the first time along with my second cousin
Wepman at Quake 2.
Â 
We established together with Wepman and Dzodzo the clan â€œSatan`s Proxiesâ€
on 13th of January 1999 which practically exists up to the presentâ€¦this is
how it all began, at least for me.

I existed on Slovak 64Kb ISDN inÂ  the years 1999-2002 and was engrossed in the
team game of Quake 3; although to run with ping 100+ was an experience for my
nerves.
I left for progaming retirement between 2003 and 2004 and then was fully
devoted to my comeback in 2005 â€“ when they introduced a cable connection in
Slovakia; to be more specific â€“ it helped me to return to the form
#tdmpickup.se.

Since then I have been virtually playing up to now. Among my greatest successes
â€“ I consider my attendance on WCG 2k2 inÂ  South Korea and several victories
at local TDM LAN.

I`d like to gain an advantage from the years spent at Quake and give you advice
at some maps â€“ how to proceed even againstÂ  stronger andÂ  more experienced
teams.
Â 
Hail the hunt!

Hi_there_outlaws_!_*by_dash

My name is Arpad !
Â 
I also go by the pseudonym "dash".

Iâ€™m an active professional teamplayer of the first person shooter series
Quake.
Â 
Iâ€™m of Hungarian nationality, resides in Budapest and at the moment I play
for the National electronic sports team of Hungary, and for an international
TDM team, called Frontline.
Â 
Iâ€™ve been playing the third episode of Quake, since 1999 (Q3 beta), and
actively competing in Quake since 2002.
Â 
I gained prominence with the gametype 2on2 TDM, which is still the most loving
mode of mine, but lately I only play 4v4 TeamDeathMatch competitively.
Â 
Iâ€™m here to help my friend dk, to share the basics of TDM, and some of the
finest tactics with beginners, and experts also.
Â 
So letâ€™s get ready to rumble, and have a good read!

About_do_the_dk_and_me_*by_dk

Hey Guys,
Â 
my Name is Cris aka â€ždkâ€œ !
I am playing for the UK Organisation / Team 4Kings.
Chek it out -> www.four-kings.com
Â 
I decided to start this site because I cant really read that much about the tdm
scene, like news, basics, tactics, where to play, how to play especially for
those who are new to the game.
Â 
I am still not sure if I will go through with it, but I give it a try !
It depends on the response and on the time it will cost. Lets seeâ€¦ Â 
Â 
For those who donâ€™t know me here the little dk story.
Â 
I started in 1997 with Quake 1, the same year I started aswell with
onlinegaming and the game Quakeworld wich is basically quake 1 just for the
internet.
My nickname was DaKilla.
The nick is really innovative, I know !
But I felt like a DaKilla because I owned my neighbor always in lan.
I think it was November 1997 where I became my first modem.
It was a 28.8 Modem. I just can tell you, AMAZING !!!!
I had like ping 300 and I was totally flashed. People flying around ( hahah
yes, I thought they was able to fly, but they just did a rocketjump ) 20 People
on the same time on ONE server, without going to the neighboor, just being at
home on your own Computer.
It was amazing and I was immediently addicted.
For not annoying you and making the story that long I will push sometimes the
forward button.
I really cnat remember but I think it was in 98 somewhen I became my 56K Modem,
WHAT a difference, I had ping 150 !!!Â 
The things became more interesting, I found my first Team, Syndicate â€“ X and
played in my first league. I still can remember to that team we prac with a
lot. TFP the fraggin pumpkins. With outcast, spawney, root66 etc. If you guys
read that â€œ HELLO ! â€œ :-)
In 99 I finally became ISDN and a really nice ping around 30 or something. And
I became better and better finally.
Not Top but better ;-) .
In QW there are really some crazy skilled people.
In 2001 I finally started with Quake 3.
I started playing Quake3 in SD but moved a few weeks later to 4Kings.
And that was the beginning of a pretty successful Gaming carrier and my
nickname change to dk wich is deka and has nothing to do anymore with dakilla :
-).
