Let's help Cris out, shall we?

* Get the content
#+begin_src bash
# Mirror the site's tree and change into local directory
wget -m http://www.dothedk.com && cd www.dothedk.com/ 

# Convert html to text. (The extension is ".org" instead of ".txt"
# because I prefer to use Emacs and org-mode.)
for i in $( find . -iname '*.html'); do html2text -style pretty -nobs -o ${i%.*}.org $i;done

# Remove all other crap to get only the tree of directories and plain
# text files
find . -type f -iname *.html -delete
rm -rf about robots.txt rss sitemap 
find . -type d -iname '*back*' -print0 | xargs -0 rm -rf 
#+end_src

* Put the thing on GitHub
Create a new repository on GitHub, choose a name, then do the
following on the command line (from inside your local mirror
directory) or follow the instructions on github:
#+begin_src bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'initial commit'
git remote add origin git@github.com:GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE/repository_name_here.git
# Might want create a working branch immediately
git branch working
git push origin master working
#+end_src
Start doing stuff, commit locally, push up changes, then see colored diff on github by
other means.
