Grim Dungeons - DM14

DM14 Strategy Guide *by dk 

 

A map with many corners. This map is played in a campy way, since DM14 is divided into 2 parts. Both sides have more or less equal health, armor, weapons and powerups.

While theoretically, the map is pretty easy to play, playing DM14 really depends on you, your Team, the opponents playing style and how the powerups spawn. DM14 is probably the most tactical of all the TDM maps, and needs careful thought. 10 Frags can be a big lead on this map.

Team in control:


The team in control will try and hold the Red Armour room.

 

It is always good starting in the Red Armor room. Tell it your mates that you have Red. They need to come quick and help you! Similarly, if at any point in the game, you secure the RA room, tell your mates, so they can move in and help secure the room.


Why do we want to hold RA?

   1. Its relatively easy to secure (discussed below).
   2. You have Red Armour + 25 armour worth of Shards ( shards are in Shotgun room )
   3. You are next to Battlestuit
   4. It is easier to access and secure the Railgun from the RA room, as compared to the YA positions.
   5. You have a total of 3 Weapons here ( RL, Rail, Shotgun )
   6. You can pressure other team through 3 routes.

 

 

Red is subdivided into 4 positions.  Make them safe and hold them !

 

1.

 
	

The first position that must be held is the RL, and the two spawns next to it.

A lot of times an enemy spawns, no one is there, enemy gets RL, then the Red Armor, and before you know it, your hold on the RA room is tenuous at best. That\u2019s not to say it will happen all the time, but if its reasonably foreseeable, and has happened a lot in the past. Plus, if you can secure this point, instead of new spawns being a danger, you will get easy spawn kills.

Also keep an eye out for enemies trying to steal RA from jumppad in middle, or from railgun area.

2.

 
	

The second position that must be held is the platform area just on top of RA, opposite to position 1.

This position can quickly grab the Red Armor, further helping keep the RA secure. Watch out for enemies trying to steal RA from middle jumppad, and from railgun area.

This position also acts as the support person. He can easily help Shotgun person (position 3) or Railgun person (position 4), as needed.

3.

 
	

The third position that must be held is the shotgun room. This is a really important position for the Red Area, especially just before the battlesuit spawns (enemy could try and rush through this room, then drop down through hole and ninja the battlesuit).

Besides that, this room has shards worth 25 Armor points (every little bit helps!), and you have the shotgun! Securing this room is absolutely critical for RA control. Try and make sure this player has a Rocket Launcher, as it makes things a lot easier.

If your team is stacked and you\u2019re holding the shotgun room, you can apply pressure at quad, by chipping away at enemies healths, grabbing their yellow armor or LG, even if you only manage to steal just 1 item. Don\u2019t over extend though, and don\u2019t push recklessly, sometimes every frag/kill can be important. Remember: your role is to hold the shotgun room, so don\u2019t needlessly chase enemies.

4.

 
	

The 4th position that must be held is the Railgun enclosure.

Secure it! And dont let the enemy get a Railgun!

This is especially important at battlesuit time, as an enemy at RG at powerup time can easily chip away at your stacked player while he waits for battlesuit, making it harder for you to battle Quad, and at worst, can knock your battlesuit carrier into the void. As you can imagine, you will lose control if the Quad then comes in and mops up. More on this below.

Out of Control.

 

The team NOT in control has to hold upper and lower YAs, and wait for next powerup.

 

You will not always start in the RA room, or will lose control of the RA room often. At such times, as soon as you realize that you are losing control, or will lose control very soon, tell your team mates to go to their \u2018out of control\u2019 positions. This is important, as you don\u2019t want to give away free frags for naught. It\u2019s not bad losing control and the RA room; it\u2019s just bad to give away free frags. Keep your weapons, build up a stack, and get back control with the next set of powerups. Its only 2 minutes away, at most.

So how do we position ourself, and safely build up a stack?

 

1 & 2.

 
	

2 persons will secure the LG/YA/Quad area.

1 has to always check Shaft/YA area incase enemy comes from there, and the 2nd has to keep an eye on the door that leads to Shotgun.

It is of absolutely, critically, vitally (you get the point) important to have the the Quad room secure when Quad is about to spawn. Nothing is more dangerous than a battlesuit with quad.

3.

 
	

The other two will secure the lower YA/RL area.

Caution: If enemy is putting pressure from shotgun room, and has a rail, think twice before using the pictured jumppad.

4.

 
	

Try to get the Railgun or at least apply pressure there.

Railgun is a really powerful tool in defending the Quadroom. If you get rail, think about switching with one of the guys at Shaft/Quad area. Ofcourse LG is also good, but a rail will definitely boost defensive power.

Powerup Time!

Securing Battlesuit.

The team that has control will generally find it easier to secure and acquire the battlesuit.

Rule: The player on your team who has the most armor is going to get Battlesuit.

So decide it already as soon as possible. Figure this out in advance of the battlesuit spawning, then get into position.

This is the best way to secure BS:

1.

 
	

Secure the Railgun! Why ?

If the enemy holds the railgun area, they can apply pressure by spamming rockets or, worse, railing. In the worst case scenario, they can rail your BS carrier into the void.

2.

 
	

Secure the Shotgun room! Why?

Enemy can go through the Shotgun and try to ninja-steal the BS by going through the hole! Although that is the worst case scenario, the enemy can easily damage the BS carrier, or perhaps knock him into void. That\u2019s why you need to secure the shotgun room.

3.

 
	

This position is also important, secure it before BS spawns. Enemy can come from lower RL and try to get BS.

Holding this position is easier and better if you have a RL. Additionally, if the Rail enclosure is lost, you can spam Rockets to Rail to shut out enemy and hopefully secure Battlesuit.

3a.

 
	

Get to position 3 by going down the jumppad in the centre of the RA room. Don\u2019t risk being voided by going through the hole on top of battlesuit! The jumppad route is quicker and safer.

4.

 
	

The player on your team who will take battlesuit has to go through using this hole.

Try NOT to be early for battlesuit (even 10 seconds early is too early). Time the battlesuit to the T, else you will risk being voided. While you\u2019re waiting to go through the Hole for battlesuit, don\u2019t weaken your own stack by greedily trying to get spawn kills. You will get 1 frag, but lose battlesuit, whereas a fully stacked battlesuit can get as many as 10 frags.

So your aim is to get the battlesuit with as much HP and Armour as you can. This is critical, as you will often have to face off against Quad very very soon.

Securing Quad.

This is the best way to secure the quad.

 

1, 2 & 3

 
	

3 People at Quad.

1st checks shaft / YA area.

2nd and 3rd keep an eye on the doors leading to the shotgun area. Watch out for Railers who apply pressure from the shotgun area doors. If that happens, use the Grenade launcher to apply counter-pressure, and push them back into the shotgun room. Do NOT let the Quad guy take damage unnecessarily. Quad is the key to wrest back control of the RA room.

4.

 
	

The 4th guy acts as a sort of spy. He checks out if enemy is coming to Quad through Railgun or Battlesuit area. If you can spam and stop them, do so, but if the situation looks dangerous, go up the jumppad, let your team mates know how many are coming from below, then spam down the pad to stop them.
